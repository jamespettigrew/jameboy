* Tetris FF85 JR Z loop
** Opcode sequence
02ED: F0 85
02EF: A7
02F0: 28

Load $FF00 + (0x0085) into A
-> LDH A
-> AND A
-> JR Z (jumps back to start)

** Appears to be due to improper VBlank interrupt handling

- Confirmed VBlank handler never being called


- Interrupt handler wasn't being called
  - Due to faulty delayed enable logic, now fixed
    - VBlank handler still not being called
      - Request flag is set
      - Enable register is 9 == 0b0000_1001
      - Should be working
      - My code is showing both bits as 0 wat
      - Actually was/is 0 at the time of the interrupt execution

 - Divergence between Sameboy and Jameboy before PC $29aa
   - Loading joypad register state!

     WORKING!!!!

* Sprite rendering
** We're now able to display a warped sprite for the 1P vs 2P selection on the Tetris menu
*** Why is it distorted?
- The correct OAM values are in the OAM region
- Let's have a look at the tile data to check what's going on
